# Drug Classification with Machine Learning & Visualization
This project is a machine learning model designed to classify drugs based on various features such as patient health metrics and drug properties. It also includes a visualization node that helps users explore the dataset and visualize the classification results.

Features
📊 Drug Classification: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, or SVM) to classify drugs.
🔍 Data Visualization: Provides visual insights into the dataset and model performance through graphs and charts (e.g., confusion matrix, feature importance, etc.).
⚙️ Customizable Models: Supports easy swapping of algorithms, parameter tuning, and model evaluation.
📈 Performance Metrics: Displays key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
